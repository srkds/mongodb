# What is Mocha?

- Mocha is a testing framework
- Database is not made for instant reply.
- when we deploy mongodb or big scale applications, usualy we place it in saperate instance and connecting this database with other servers.
  so this connections are never instant.
- Mocha helps us to write test cases for javascript for asyncronous behaviour of database
